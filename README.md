# Hello-World-
This is the first repository of mine!

=======
Hum, this is very interesting to me. I'm a Ph. D of Microbiogy, but I quited my science career and become one member of a outresouring company which helps doctors with their science project, and my job is to facilitate doctors to publish their SCI papers by helping them designing their experiment, analyzing their data, organizing their materials, and improving their writing language. But I realy do not want to do this for my entire life, and I want to learn some other skills which can benefit my job. So I want to learn how to code and how to do more comprehensive data analysis with some programming language. So for, I've finished all the content in Codeacademy on Python, a lesson on R Language on Edx, and a book on R Language. And now I'm taking a lesson on  Coursera on Python and reading a book about statisical analysis using R language. I hope GitHub can help me with my job.
